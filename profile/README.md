## 🔧 About Us  

The Aero-Modelling Club (AMC) at IIT (BHU), Varanasi brings together students passionate about designing, building, and flying model aircraft, drones, and UAVs. Through hands-on projects, workshops, competitions, and community learning initiatives, AMC serves as a technical platform for:

- Aircraft and drone design, simulation, and control  
- Autonomous flight systems and drone-tech challenges  
- Learning and mastering tools related to robotics, flight-control, and aerodynamics  
- Organizing summer/winter camps, workshops, and competitions for members and newcomers  

For more information, visit our website or contact us at **TBA**.

## 🌐 Our Ecosystem  

Beyond code repositories, the Club actively fosters community involvement through:  

- Technical workshops on aerodynamics, RC aircraft, drone systems, robotics and control systems.
- Campus-level and inter-college events, drone-challenges, flight-model demos and competitions.
- Use of simulation tools (e.g., Webots) for safe practice and virtual testing of UAV/drones before hardware deployment.
- Encouraging learning across disciplines — mechanical design, electronics, software (ROS, Python, C/C++), control systems and embedded programming.
